						<p>I am a seasoned Digital Marketing Manager. My introduction to the world of advertising started with a stint at
							118118 Media where I first mastered the basics of advertising and had my first taste of digital media for local
							business.</p>
						<p>I then focussed purely in local business digital marketing, with Google's largest global partner at the time with
							33,000 clients. We developed cutting edge technology which was a game-changer in the online advertising world and
							created the first conversion-based optimisation model, which has now become industry standard.</p>
						<p>I am presently in my 3rd Year at the University of Wolverhampton studying an undergraduate degree in Marketing.</p>

								This was truly an eye-opening experience as some of the challenges were very real and very traumatic and you learn very quickly how to respect someone's privacy
								while at the same time, providing a framework for them to get the help they need in order to reconcile their experiences. For many of these children, the camp
								provided an escape where they were allowed room to think and work out their feelings on a number of subjects as well as allowing young people to be young and enjoy
								their Summer while having fun in a safe & controlled environment.
							</p>
							<p>
								I truly believe that this experience gave me the skills I shall need to go through life as a sensible and level-headed individual. It also taught me how to
								approach certain challenges and unexpected situations. Prior to this, I would not have known the right approach and this will help me with all future jobs &
								roles of responsibility. I look forward to putting these amazing skills to good use for the right organisation.

						<p>I have a varied range of hobbies and interests. I love to keep my mind active and read a lot of books. Typically, this
							would be factual or biographies as opposed to fiction. I also consume a lot of documentaries.</p>
						<p>The quarantine has given me a wonderful opportunity to pick up new skills and so I've taken up a course in videography
							&amp; editing. It's early days yet but over time I shall educate myself to a level of competence &amp; even professionalism. These skills would compliment my existing skillset in terms of digital marketing &amp; content creation. It's a superb skill to be able to offer a future employer as I already have a grasp of websites &amp; social media.</p>
						<p>For relation, I play the guitar &amp; I work out. I believe it's important to remain physically fit &amp;
							healthy so that you can offer your employer the best version of yourself. I believe I would be an asset to any

							<p>"Shay, to this very day is one of our favourite camp counsellors. Camp life is challenging as you're often dealing with young adults
								who may have their own trauma or have had difficult home lives. When they arrive at our camp, it provides an escape from the
								day-today lives they know. Our role is to make is a safe & fun environment as much as possible.	Shay was placed in the drama
								camp & immediately set about working closely with the team, both to help devise plays and also to generally make drama a fun
								place where you'd want to be for the children. His infectious laugh and sense of humour were perfect & the kind of personality
								we'd hoped for. He'd entertain with his guitar and was always happy to deputise if another counsellor needed help or support.
								That Summer, we received many letters saying that is was one of the best ever & Shay played a big part in it. I couldn't be
								happier recommending him to any future employer. I'd say go ahead; you'll be glad you did"</p>
